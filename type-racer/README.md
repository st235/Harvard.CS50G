# Type Racer

This is a final project for the course!

### Implementation details

- Your game must be in either LÖVE or Unity.
- Your game must be a cohesive start-to-finish experience for the user; the game should boot up, allow the user to play toward some end goal, and feature a means of quitting the game.
- Your game should have at least three `GameState`s to separate the flow of your game’s user experience, even if it’s as simple as a `StartState`, a `PlayState`, and an `EndState`, though you’re encouraged to implement more as needed to suit a more robust game experience (e.g., a fantasy game with a `MenuState` or even a separate `CombatState`).
- Your game can be most any genre you’d like, though there needs to be a definitive way of winning (or at least scoring indefinitely) and losing the game, be it against the computer or another player. This can take many forms; some loss conditions could be running out of time in a puzzle game, being slain by monsters in an RPG, and so on, while some winning conditions may be defeating a final boss in an RPG, making it to the end of a series of levels in a platformer, and tallying score in a puzzle game until it becomes impossible to do more.
- You are allowed to use libraries and assets in either game development environment, but the bulk of your game’s logic must be handwritten (i.e., putting together an RPG in Unity while using a UI library would be considered valid, assuming the bulk of the game logic is also not implemented in a library, but recycling a near-complete game prototype from Unity’s asset store with slightly changed labels, materials, etc. would not be acceptable).

> The most common cause for failure of the final project is not spending enough effort on this next instruction. Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should provide a relatively comprehensive documentation of what you did and, if applicable, why you did it. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that you are proud of and that documents your project thoroughly, and that distinguishes this project from others in the course and defends its complexity!

- Your project must be at least as complex as (and distinct from!) the games you’ve implemented in this course, and should really be moreso. Submissions of low complexity may be rejected! You must explain your game in detail and why you believe it to meet the complexity and distinctiveness requirement in a `README.md` file at the root of your project.
