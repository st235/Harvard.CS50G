# CS50G Assignments

I recently took the Harvard CS50G class and worked on some cool homework assignments. Since Harvard discontinued the course, I thought it might be helpful to share my work here for anyone still interested in watching the lectures. Enjoy!

You can check out demos of the projects I made [on Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLucKuGqiOAE8lcp4X8El6I5XHNlzYsyyK&si=TVqvDUp74LubgLbI).
